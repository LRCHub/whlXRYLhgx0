I got the talk when I was younger
And understood as I recall
They hadn't mentioned this at all
My heart was racing like a sprinter
That tripped and fell
In love with a girl just for tonight and that's all
I've got big, big plans
And they've got to mean something more
Than just once
But I just don't know what I want
I'm gonna tear your ass up like we just got married
And you're all mine now
Tonight is the night we've been waiting for all our lives
Or maybe for just tonight
I got the call when I was older
Yeah and I understood
If it happens then it happens and that's all
My arms the hose and you're the fire
Out of control and I've got put you out
Before there's nothing left at all
I've got big, big plans
And they've got to mean something more than just once
But I just don't know what I want
I'm gonna tear your ass up like we just got married
And you're all mine now
Tonight is the night we've been waiting for all our lives
Or maybe for just mine
Get your ass up 'cause you're in no hurry
Like I am now
I'm getting older and older all of the time
Or maybe for just tonight
And the next part is the hardest
To admit and explain but I've got to get it right
She said, "I'll chew you up and spit you out like all them
I'm gonna put you right back in my mouth
You know that I will always love you"
I tore your ass up like we just got married
And you're all mine now
'Cause tonight is the night we've been waiting for all our lives
Or maybe its just
You've gotta get your ass up 'cause you're in no hurry
Like I am now
I'm getting older and older all of the time
Oh, baby, one more time
I'm gonna tear your ass up like we just got married
And you're all mine now
I'm getting older and older all of the time
Or maybe it's just mine
Over tonight
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), ooh, yeah
